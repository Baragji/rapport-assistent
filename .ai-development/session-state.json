Completed S3.1-S3.5 tasks: enhanced interactive charts, live form validation, responsive design, loading states/animations, and performance optimizations. Fixed TypeScript error in ReportForm.tsx where keyof ReportFormData was not assignable to string parameter - resolved by adding String() conversion in handleFieldChange function. Build now passes without errors. Ready to continue with S3.6 form UX enhancements implementation.",
