# Current Session Handoff

## Current Status
- **Session**: 023
- **Date**: 2025-02-05
- **Task**: S3.5: Performance Optimizations
- **Status**: Ready to start
- **Tests**: 299 passing
- **Coverage**: 80.5%
- **Build**: Passing
- **Lint**: Passing

## Completed Work
- Fixed LoadingSpinner tests to properly check for visible label using data-testid
- Updated tests to handle screen reader text correctly
- Fixed AnimatedButton tests to use vi.fn() instead of jest.fn() for mocking
- Updated tests to use data-testid selectors instead of role selectors
- Fixed loading state tests to check for correct spinner rendering
- Fixed ReportForm tests to use correct selectors and assertions
- Added delay in tests to account for setTimeout in components
- Ensured all 299 tests are now passing

## Next Steps
- Implement performance optimizations (Task S3.5)
- Create LazyChart component for lazy loading chart visualizations
- Implement usePerformanceMonitor hook for tracking metrics
- Create performanceUtils for measuring and optimizing performance
- Optimize Vite configuration for better bundle size
- Implement code splitting for larger components
- Add performance monitoring and metrics collection

## Implementation Plan for S3.5
1. Create LazyChart component that loads chart only when visible
2. Implement usePerformanceMonitor hook to track key metrics
3. Add performance utilities for measuring render times
4. Optimize bundle size through code splitting
5. Implement memory usage optimizations
6. Add performance testing to CI pipeline

## Known Issues
- Chart components may cause performance issues on low-end devices
- Large form submissions might cause UI freezes
- Need to optimize animation performance for mobile devices

## Rollback Point
- Current commit is a stable checkpoint
- All 299 tests passing
- Can rollback to previous commit if needed
