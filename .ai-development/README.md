# AI Development Continuity System

This directory contains files that enable seamless handoffs between AI development sessions, addressing context window limitations.

## System Overview

The development continuity system treats context window limits as a known architectural constraint and provides:

- **Persistent State Tracking**: Current progress and next steps
- **Atomic Task Breakdown**: Work units sized for context limits
- **Rollback Points**: Safe recovery states
- **Handoff Protocol**: Standardized session transitions

## File Structure

- `session-state.json` - Current development status and next actions
- `sprint-3-implementation-plan.md` - Master plan broken into atomic tasks
- `work-log.md` - Detailed log of all changes and decisions
- `handoff-checklist.md` - Protocol for session transitions
- `README.md` - This overview document

## Usage

### Starting a New Session
1. Read `session-state.json` to understand current status
2. Review `work-log.md` for recent context
3. Follow next task from `sprint-3-implementation-plan.md`
4. Use `handoff-checklist.md` for verification

### During Development
1. Update `session-state.json` before starting each task
2. Log all changes and decisions in `work-log.md`
3. Make frequent commits with descriptive messages
4. Run tests after significant changes

### Ending a Session
1. Complete current atomic task or rollback to checkpoint
2. Update all tracking files
3. Create rollback point (commit + tag)
4. Follow handoff checklist

## Recovery Protocol

If a session ended unexpectedly:
1. Check `session-state.json` for last known state
2. Verify current state with tests
3. Rollback to last checkpoint if needed
4. Continue from last successful task

## Design Principles

- **Atomic Tasks**: Each task completable within context limits
- **Crash-Safe**: System can recover from any interruption
- **Self-Documenting**: Full context preserved in files
- **Test-Driven**: Verification at each step
- **Rollback-Ready**: Multiple recovery points available

This system ensures development continuity regardless of context window limitations.
