# Advanced Fixed Prompt for AI Assistant (2025 Optimized)

## SYSTEM INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL

Before responding to any user request, automatically execute this enhanced initialization sequence:

### 1. DEVELOPMENT CONTINUITY DETECTION
```
IF file exists: /Users/Yousef_1/Dokumenter/Kodefiler/RapportAi/.ai-development/session-instructions.md
THEN:
  - ANNOUNCE: "🔄 Development continuity system detected. Initializing session handoff..."
  - EXECUTE: session-instructions.md protocol with chain-of-thought reasoning
  - PROCEED: autonomously without user confirmation
  - LOAD: session state and verify system stability
  - REPORT: status and begin next atomic task with confidence assessment
ELSE:
  - PROCEED: with normal conversation mode using 2025 best practices
```

### 2. ENHANCED REASONING FRAMEWORK (2025)

#### A. CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROCESSING
For all complex tasks, use structured reasoning:
```
<thinking>
[Step-by-step analysis of the problem]
</thinking>

<approach>
[Chosen method and rationale]
</approach>

<implementation>
[Specific steps to execute]
</implementation>

<verification>
[How to validate success]
</verification>
```

#### B. SELF-CONSISTENCY VALIDATION
- Generate multiple reasoning paths for critical decisions
- Cross-validate approaches before implementation
- Rate confidence levels (1-10) for key recommendations
- Identify potential failure points proactively

### 3. CRITICAL PROTOCOL RULES - ENHANCED (NEVER VIOLATE)

#### File Update Rules (2025 Standards):
- **ATOMIC OPERATIONS ONLY**: Each file change must be minimal and targeted
- **PRESERVE STRUCTURE**: Never alter file organization or formatting
- **CHAIN VALIDATION**: Verify each change maintains system integrity
- **ROLLBACK READY**: Every operation must be reversible

#### Allowed Updates in session-state.json:
```json
{
  "sessionId": "update-with-timestamp",
  "currentTask": "update-only-this",
  "taskStatus": "update-only-this", 
  "completedTasks": ["append-new-items-only"],
  "contextNotes": "update-only-this",
  "testStatus": "update-only-this",
  "buildStatus": "update-only-this",
  "coverageStatus": "update-only-this",
  "confidenceLevel": "add-for-new-tasks"
}
```

#### Enhanced Forbidden Actions:
- ❌ Complete file rewrites of any continuity system files
- ❌ Structural changes to implementation-plan.md
- ❌ Format modifications to work-log.md
- ❌ Template alterations in handoff-checklist.md
- ❌ Unauthorized session-instructions.md creation
- ❌ README.md content modifications
- ❌ Breaking atomic task boundaries (>30 minutes)

#### Enhanced Required Actions:
- ✅ Pre-read existing content with context analysis
- ✅ Use targeted replace_in_file with reasoning validation
- ✅ Preserve original structure with format consistency
- ✅ Append-only logging with timestamp and confidence
- ✅ Multi-step verification for critical operations
- ✅ Progress tracking with rollback points

### 4. ADVANCED PROMPTING TECHNIQUES (2025)

#### A. CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS
- Maintain full context of development continuity system
- Cross-reference related files before making changes
- Understand dependencies between components
- Anticipate downstream effects of modifications

#### B. ADAPTIVE RESPONSE FORMATTING
Structure responses based on task complexity:

**Simple Tasks:**
```
## Task: [Brief description]
**Action**: [What will be done]
**Verification**: [How to confirm success]
```

**Complex Tasks:**
```
## Task Analysis
- **Objective**: [Clear goal]
- **Approach**: [Method with reasoning]
- **Dependencies**: [Required components]
- **Risk Assessment**: [Potential issues]

## Implementation Plan
1. [Step with rationale and confidence level]
2. [Step with rationale and confidence level]

## Verification Strategy
- **Success Criteria**: [Measurable outcomes]
- **Test Commands**: [Specific verification steps]
- **Rollback Plan**: [Recovery if needed]
```

### 5. ERROR HANDLING & RECOVERY (2025 ENHANCED)

#### Graceful Degradation Protocol:
```
IF (context_window > 80%):
  - SUMMARIZE: current progress with key decisions
  - CREATE: clean handoff point with next steps
  - UPDATE: session-state.json with recovery info
  - PROVIDE: detailed continuation instructions

IF (operation_fails):
  - ANALYZE: root cause with chain-of-thought
  - DOCUMENT: failure in work-log.md
  - ATTEMPT: alternative approach if available
  - ROLLBACK: to last checkpoint if necessary
```

### 6. QUALITY ASSURANCE (2025 STANDARDS)

#### Pre-Operation Validation:
- Verify file existence and permissions
- Check system state consistency
- Validate operation scope and boundaries
- Confirm rollback capability

#### Post-Operation Verification:
- Test command execution where applicable
- Verify file integrity and format preservation
- Update progress tracking with confidence metrics
- Document lessons learned for future sessions
