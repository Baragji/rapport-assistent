+# Implementation Plan - CI/CD and Testing Setup
+
+## Overview
+This plan breaks down the implementation into atomic tasks that can be completed within context window limits.
+
+## Phase 1: Foundation Setup ‚úÖ
+- [x] Create development continuity system
+- [x] Initialize session tracking
+- [ ] Create initial checkpoint
+
+## Phase 2: Component Refactoring (Estimated: 3 atomic tasks)
+### Task 2.1: Extract PieChart Component
+- **Estimated Time**: 15 minutes
+- **Description**: Extract chart logic from App.tsx into separate PieChart component
+- **Files to modify**:

+- **Description**: Set up branch protection rules
+- **Platform**: GitHub repository settings
+- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
+  - Main branch requires PR reviews
+  - CI checks must pass before merge
+  - Direct pushes to main are blocked
+
+## Phase 4: DOCX Implementation (Estimated: 2 atomic tasks)
+### Task 4.1: Implement DOCX Export
+- **Estimated Time**: 30 minutes
+- **Description**: Replace placeholder with real DOCX generation
+- **Files to modify**:

+- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
+  - Tests actual DOCX generation
+  - Tests file structure and content
+  - Coverage > 80% for documentUtils
+- **Test Command**: `npm run test:coverage`
+
+## Rollback Strategy
+Each task creates a git commit. If a task fails or context runs out:
+1. Check session-state.json for last successful checkpoint
+2. Run `git reset --hard <checkpoint-commit>`
+3. Update session-state.json to reflect rollback
+4. Continue from last known good state
+
+## Success Metrics
+- All tests passing
+- Coverage > 80% overall
+- CI/CD pipeline functional
+- DOCX export working
+- No regression in existing functionality
+# Development Work Log
+
+## Session 001 - 2024-12-19
+
+### 10:00 - Session Start
+- **Context**: User requested systematic approach to handle context window limitations
+- **Goal**: Create development continuity system for seamless session handoffs
+- **Current State**: Project has basic React app with form, chart, and placeholder DOCX export
+
+### 10:05 - Analysis Complete
+- **Findings**: 
+  - Current test coverage ~37%
+  - No CI/CD pipeline
+  - PieChart embedded in App.tsx (needs extraction)
+  - DOCX export is placeholder implementation
+- **Risk Assessment**: Context window limitation could break development mid-sprint
+- **Solution**: Create atomic task system with persistent state tracking
+
+### 10:10 - Development Continuity System Setup
+- **Created Files**:
+  - `.ai-development/session-state.json` - Session tracking
+  - `.ai-development/implementation-plan.md` - Atomic task breakdown
+  - `.ai-development/work-log.md` - This log file
+- **Next**: Create handoff checklist and establish first checkpoint
+
+### Decisions Made
+1. **Atomic Task Size**: 15-30 minutes max to fit within context limits
+2. **Checkpoint Strategy**: Git commits after each successful task
+3. **Recovery Strategy**: Rollback to last known good state if needed
+4. **Documentation**: Persistent state in JSON + markdown for human readability
+
+### Current Status
+- ‚úÖ Development continuity system created
+- ‚è≥ Ready to begin Phase 2: Component Refactoring
+- üéØ Next Task: Extract PieChart Component (Task 2.1)
+# Session Handoff Checklist
+
+## For Ending Current Session
+
+### Pre-Handoff Verification
+- [ ] Current task is either completed or safely rolled back
+- [ ] All tests are passing (`npm test`)
+- [ ] No uncommitted changes that would break the build
+- [ ] session-state.json is updated with current status
+- [ ] work-log.md reflects all changes made
+
+### Handoff Information
+- [ ] Update session-state.json with:
+  - Current task status
+  - Next recommended task
+  - Any context notes for next session
+  - Current branch and commit hash
+- [ ] Create rollback point (git commit + tag)
+- [ ] Document any issues or blockers encountered
+- [ ] Note any deviations from the implementation plan
+
+### Final Checks
+- [ ] Run `npm run build` to ensure build works
+- [ ] Run `npm run test:coverage` to check coverage status
+- [ ] Commit all tracking files to git
+
+## For Starting New Session
+
+### Session Initialization
+- [ ] Read session-state.json to understand current status
+- [ ] Review work-log.md for recent context and decisions
+- [ ] Check implementation-plan.md for next atomic task
+- [ ] Verify tests are passing (`npm test`)
+- [ ] Confirm build works (`npm run build`)
+
+### Context Recovery
+- [ ] Understand what was completed in previous session
+- [ ] Identify current task and its acceptance criteria
+- [ ] Review any risk factors or blockers noted
+- [ ] Confirm rollback points are available if needed
+
+### Ready to Proceed
+- [ ] Update session-state.json with new session ID and start time
+- [ ] Begin next atomic task from implementation plan
+- [ ] Update work-log.md with session start notes
+
+## Emergency Recovery Protocol
+
+If previous session ended unexpectedly:
+1. Check session-state.json for last known good state
+2. Run tests to verify current state
+3. If tests fail, rollback to last rollback point:
+   ```bash
+   git log --oneline --grep="ROLLBACK-POINT"
+   git reset --hard <commit-hash>
+   ```
+4. Update session-state.json to reflect recovery
+5. Continue from last successful task
+
+## Communication Template for User
+
+When context window is approaching limit:
+
+"I'm approaching my context window limit. Let me create a clean handoff point:
+
+**Current Status**: [Brief description of what was accomplished]
+**Next Task**: [Specific next atomic task from implementation plan]
+**Rollback Point**: [Git commit hash if rollback needed]
+**Notes**: [Any important context for next session]
+
+Please start a new chat session and ask me to continue the development. I'll pick up exactly where we left off using the session state files."
+# AI Development Continuity System
+
+This directory contains files that enable seamless handoffs between AI development sessions, addressing context window limitations.
+
+## System Overview
+
+The development continuity system treats context window limits as a known architectural constraint and provides:
+
+- **Persistent State Tracking**: Current progress and next steps
+- **Atomic Task Breakdown**: Work units sized for context limits
+- **Rollback Points**: Safe recovery states
+- **Handoff Protocol**: Standardized session transitions
+
+## File Structure
+
+- `session-state.json` - Current development status and next actions
+- `implementation-plan.md` - Master plan broken into atomic tasks
+- `work-log.md` - Detailed log of all changes and decisions
+- `handoff-checklist.md` - Protocol for session transitions
+- `README.md` - This overview document
+
+## Usage
+
+### Starting a New Session
+1. Read `session-state.json` to understand current status
+2. Review `work-log.md` for recent context
+3. Follow next task from `implementation-plan.md`
+4. Use `handoff-checklist.md` for verification
+
+### During Development
+1. Update `session-state.json` before starting each task
+2. Log all changes and decisions in `work-log.md`
+3. Make frequent commits with descriptive messages
+4. Run tests after significant changes
+
+### Ending a Session
+1. Complete current atomic task or rollback to checkpoint
+2. Update all tracking files
+3. Create rollback point (commit + tag)
+4. Follow handoff checklist
+
+## Recovery Protocol
+
+If a session ended unexpectedly:
+1. Check `session-state.json` for last known state
+2. Verify current state with tests
+3. Rollback to last checkpoint if needed
+4. Continue from last successful task
+
+## Design Principles
+
+- **Atomic Tasks**: Each task completable within context limits
+- **Crash-Safe**: System can recover from any interruption
+- **Self-Documenting**: Full context preserved in files
+- **Test-Driven**: Verification at each step
+- **Rollback-Ready**: Multiple recovery points available
+
+This system ensures development continuity regardless of context window limitations.
Now let me create the initial checkpoint and begin the first atomic task:
