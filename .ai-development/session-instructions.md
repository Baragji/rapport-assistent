- **Session ID**: session-017
- **Start Time**: 2025-01-30T10:00:00Z
- **Current Phase**: sprint-3-development
- **Current Task**: S3.3-responsive-design-improvements
- **Task Status**: not-started

## Project Context
This is the RapportAI project, a React application for generating academic reports with AI assistance. We're currently in Sprint 3, focusing on Visuals & UX Polish features.

## Recent Progress
- Completed Sprint 1: Foundation
- Completed Sprint 2: AI-Assist & Reference Manager
- Completed Task S3.1: Enhanced Interactive Charts
- Completed Task S3.2: Live Form Validation with Visual Feedback
- Implemented useFormValidation hook for form validation
- Added validation utilities for different field types
- Integrated validation with ReportForm and References components
- Added visual indicators for valid/invalid fields
- Implemented real-time validation feedback
- Added comprehensive test coverage for validation features
- All 272 tests are passing with improved code quality
- Improved test coverage to 78.32%

## Current Task Details
The next task is to enhance responsive design for mobile devices (S3.3). This involves:

1. Improving layout and component sizing for small screens (320px+)
2. Implementing responsive navigation and form controls
3. Optimizing touch interactions for mobile users
4. Ensuring proper spacing and readability on all screen sizes
5. Testing and fixing any responsive design issues

## Files to Update
- `/rapport-assistent/src/components/ReportForm.tsx` - Enhance responsive layout
- `/rapport-assistent/src/components/References.tsx` - Improve mobile experience
- `/rapport-assistent/src/index.css` - Add responsive utility classes
- `/rapport-assistent/src/components/AIFeedback.tsx` - Optimize for small screens
- `/rapport-assistent/src/components/AIAssistButton.tsx` - Improve touch targets
- `/rapport-assistent/src/components/__tests__/` - Add responsive design tests

## Test Status
- All 272 tests are passing
- Current coverage: 78.32%

## Next Steps
1. Enhance responsive design for mobile devices (current task)
2. Add loading states and smooth animations (S3.4)
3. Implement performance optimizations (S3.5)
4. Add accessibility improvements (S3.6)
5. Apply visual polish and consistent theming (S3.7)

## Handoff Notes
The live form validation task has been completed successfully. The form now provides real-time validation feedback with visual indicators for valid/invalid fields. A new useFormValidation hook has been created to handle form validation logic, along with validation utility functions for different field types. The validation has been integrated with the ReportForm and References components. All tests are passing, and test coverage has been improved. The next task is to enhance responsive design for mobile devices to ensure a good user experience across all screen sizes.

## Verification Steps
1. Run tests to ensure all 272 tests are still passing
2. Check that the build is successful
3. Verify that linting is clean
4. Test the form validation by entering invalid data and observing the feedback
5. Confirm that validation errors are displayed correctly for all field types

## Rollback Information
If needed, you can roll back to the latest commit after completing the live form validation task (commit S3.2-live-form-validation-complete).
